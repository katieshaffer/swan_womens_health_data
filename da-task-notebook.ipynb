    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook contains instructions for a short task which will give you an insight into some of what Vira Health is working on.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is structured around building a simple report that summarises what you think are the important and interesting characteristics of the datasets provided.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is purposely open-ended and we're most interested in seeing how you approach it rather than expecting a complete, sophisticated analysis. \n",
    "As such, we would encourage you to spend no more than 2-4 hours on the task.  \n",

    "Data provided is courtesy of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) and is publically available from their [website](https://www.swanstudy.org/).      \n",

    "Additional documentation can be found in the ICPSR data repository [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/00253) and may be helpful to support completion of the task.  "
