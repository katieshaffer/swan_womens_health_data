## Summary 

This project looked at data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) study. It is a longitudinal study that provides insight into the under-researched topic of women's health, particularly for middle-aged women.

The ```da-task-notebook``` contains my analysis and data visualizations. I also included a `ProfileReport.html` file, which is referenced within that notebook.

Data provided is courtesy of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) and is publically available from their [website](https://www.swanstudy.org/).
